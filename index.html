            <h1>About Geoff</h1>
            <p>Geoff Borman was born in New York, New York and grew up in northen New Jersey. He developed a love of theater and film from a young age and went
                on to major in acting at Boston University. In 2009, having completed his BFA, Geoff moved to back to New York. He lived there until 
                2020. During this time Geoff worked in a number of positions in theater administration and customer service. Following the COVID 19 pandemic, Geoff 
                made the move to be closer to family, as well as began thinking about a career switch.

            <p> While in lockdown, with no comedy, no theater, no customers, Geoff started thinking about a new career path.
                Enter ZELDA! While playing one of his favorite video games (Zelda), Geoff found himself starting to think, how 
                do they make a game like this? This then brought Geoff to our dear friend Google (link located above). After
                just a few inquiries, Geoff got his answer: coding! And with his answer Geoff began learning how one goes about
                developing the skills needed to become a coder or software engineer!
