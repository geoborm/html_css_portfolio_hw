    <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
    <p> Once upon a time, Geoff was living in New York and working happily in a 
        comedy club, but then one day Covid 19 put a stop to that. Geoff knew it
        was time to change with the changing times. He wanted to find a career path
        that would allow him more stability than nightlife and showbiz, but something that
        allowed him to use his creative and problem solving skills. Enter: ZELDA. </p>
